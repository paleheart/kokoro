# KOKORO TEST CASE 1

# This test case tests the store command


# Test storing multiple variables to make sure symbols are assigned properly
STORE 10 IN x AS NUMBER
STORE 20 IN y AS NUMBER
STORE 33 IN z AS NUMBER

# Test getting values from variables and storing them in other variables

STORE x IN g AS NUMBER
STORE z + x IN h AS NUMBER

# Test Array assignment

STORE 10, 20, 30 IN t AS ARRAY OF  3 NUMBERS

# test getting data out of an Array

STORE t's array value 3 IN e AS NUMBER

# write and read memory

STORE 33 IN MEMORY ff00 AS NUMBER

STORE MEMORY ff00 IN n AS NUMBER

# Verify by checking the memory locations for proper assignments
